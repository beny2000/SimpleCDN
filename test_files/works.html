    <h2>Codebreaking during World War II</h2>
    <p>During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, where he helped break the Enigma code used by the German military. He designed a machine called the bombe, which was used to decrypt messages encrypted by the Enigma machine. This work is widely considered to have shortened the war by several years and saved countless lives.</p>

    <h2>Computer Science</h2>
    <p>After the war, Turing worked on developing some of the earliest computers, including the Manchester Mark 1 and the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE). He also developed the concept of a universal Turing machine, which is a theoretical machine that can compute any algorithm that can be computed by a computer.</p>
